# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code of my personal website.

The site serves as a living overview of who I am professionally, where I come from, and where I am heading. It is intentionally kept simple and focused, combining both my technical journey and personal interests in one place.

## About

I work at the intersection of infrastructure, cloud technologies and hands-on engineering.  
My background includes working with physical and virtual infrastructure, operational support, and building practical solutions that solve real problems.

Alongside my professional work, I actively build and maintain personal projects to deepen my understanding of system design, automation and modern web technologies. This website reflects that mindset: learning by doing, documenting progress, and continuously improving.

## What you will find here

- **Experience**  
  An overview of my professional background and responsibilities, with a focus on reliability, operations and technical ownership.

- **Projects**  
  Selected personal projects, including a Python/Django-based booking system and a structured automotive data dataset. These projects represent how I approach problem solving, architecture and continuous iteration.

- **Certifications**  
  Completed and ongoing certifications that support my learning path, including cloud and service management topics.

- **Sports & Personal Activity**  
  Regular physical activity is an important part of how I stay focused and disciplined. This section reflects consistency, goal setting and long-term commitment.

- **Donations**  
  A small but meaningful section highlighting causes I choose to support. Giving back is important to me, especially in areas involving children, healthcare and families in need.

## Purpose of this site

This website is not meant to be a polished marketing page.  
It is a personal snapshot of my journey so far, showing growth, curiosity and consistency over time.

It is primarily used as a reference point during interviews and technical discussions, offering context beyond a traditional CV.

## Technologies

The site is built using simple, transparent technologies:

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Lightweight animations and visual elements
- No frameworks, no tracking, no unnecessary complexity

The focus is on clarity, performance and maintainability.

## Continuous improvement

Like my projects, this website evolves over time.  
Content and structure are updated as I learn new things, complete certifications or start new initiatives.
